Bizcard Extraction is a Python application built with Streamlit, EasyOCR, OpenCV, regex function, and MySQL database. It allows users to extract information from business cards and store it in a MySQL database for further analysis. The main purpose of Bizcard is to automate the process of extracting key details from business card images, such as the name, designation, company, contact information, and other relevant data. By leveraging the power of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) provided by EasyOCR, Bizcard is able to extract text from the images.

Project Overview
BizCardX is a user-friendly tool for extracting information from business cards. The tool uses OCR technology to recognize text on business cards and extracts the data into a SQL database after classification using regular expressions. Users can access the extracted information using a GUI built using streamlit. The BizCardX application is a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button. Further the data stored in database can be easily Read, updated and deleted by user as per the requirement.

What is EasyOCR?
EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from business cards.
